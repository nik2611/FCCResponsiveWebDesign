box-sizing: content-box;

The box-sizing property is used to set this behavior. By default, 
the content-box model is used. With this model, when an element has a 
specific width, that width is calculated based only on the element's content. 
Padding and border values get added to the total width, so the element grows 
to accommodate these values.*/

box-sizing: border-box;
/*The border-box sizing model does the opposite of content-box. The total width 
of the element, including padding and border, will be the explicit width set. 
The content of the element will shrink to make room for the padding and border.*/
