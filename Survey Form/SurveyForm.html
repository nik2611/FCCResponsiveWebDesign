      Character encoding in HTML defines how a sequence of bytes in an HTML document is 
      interpreted and displayed as human-readable text by web browsers. Essentially, 
      it's a mapping between numeric values (bytes) and specific characters like letters, 
      numbers, symbols, and special characters.

      UTF-8 is a variable-width encoding that can represent virtually all characters 
      from all writing systems in the world, making it ideal for multilingual web content.

      It is an HTML meta tag that helps make your web page responsive.
      It tells the browser to set the page width to the deviceâ€™s width and set the 
      initial zoom level to 1. This ensures your layout adapts well to different 
      screen sizes, especially on mobile devices.
